# ARCHIVED. Using multi image building on boxkit repo.

# debain-boxkit


## Description

Modified template from github repo [https://github.com/ublue-os/boxkit](https://github.com/ublue-os/boxkit)

boxkit is a set of GitHub actions and skeleton files to build toolbox and distrobox images. Basically, clone this repo, make the changes you want, and then build what you need.

## How to use

### Create Box

If you use distrobox:

    distrobox create -i ghcr.io/adderflight/debian-boxkit -n debian
    distrobox enter boxkit
    
If you use toolbox:

    toolbox create -i ghcr.io/adderflight/debian-boxkit -c debian
    toolbox enter boxkit

### Pull down your config

Use `chezmoi` to pull down your dotfiles and set up git sync.

### Make your own

Fork and add programs to this this image - over time you'll end up with the perfect CLI for you.
Keeping it as a pet works, though the author recommends leaving all your config in git and routinely pulling a new image.

The user experience is much nicer if you [set your terminal open right in the container](https://distrobox.privatedns.org/useful_tips/#using-distrobox-as-main-cli) and is the intended experience. 

## Finding Good Base Images

Of course you can make this however you want, but start with the [Toolbx Community images](https://github.com/toolbx-images/images).
These are a set of mostly-stock images with packages needed to run as a toolbox/distrobox already installed. 

Try to derive your blingbox from those base images so we can all help maintain them over time, you can't have bling without good stock!
